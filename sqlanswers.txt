1)What are Scalar functions and write a query?

CREATE FUNCTION GetFullName (FirstName varchar(50), LastName varchar(50))
RETURNS varchar(101)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE FullName varchar(101)
    SET FullName = FirstName + ' ' + LastName
    RETURN FullName
END


2)    inner join
      left join
      right join
       outerjion


join is a compareing two tables values 

inner join is a  only return matching values

A LEFT JOIN returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, the right columns will have NULL values.

A RIGHT JOIN returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, the left columns will have NULL values.

A FULL OUTER JOIN returns all the rows from both tables. If there is no match, the corresponding columns will have NULL values.


3)   alter tablename
     modify oldcolumnname to newcolumnname varchar(20);


4)select phonenumber,count(*) from customers group by phonenumber having count(*)>1;


5) distinct statement is used in get a unique values from  table 

 ex: select distinct studentname from customers;


7)select max(salary) from employee where department=" civil";

8)sql operators

comparison operator
select age from customers where age>28;

logicalopertors
select age from customers where age>28 and bloodgroup="a+";

string operators
select first_name from customers where first_name like  'D%';

Arithmetic Operators
select monthsalary*12 from labours;

9)select * from employee limit 5;

10) select * from employee order by desc limit 5;

11)select salary from employee order by desc limit 3 ofset 1;

12) create table tablename like oldtablename;
    insert into newtablename select * from oldtablename;

13) select * from employee where department is null;
